# Recipes
I'm building a website to host some of my mother's South Indian recipes. I'm not 100% sure yet which recipes I'll write down here, but I can guarantee that they will be tasty af. 

This site is mostly intended to help me brush up my HTML skills, and later on, learn how to work with CSS and Javascript. It's going to be quite basic for now, but I'll continue improving it with pictures, videos and probably even short pull-out explainers for people like me who don't have a natural affinity for cooking.

Onward and upward!
