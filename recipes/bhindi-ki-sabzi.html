	<h1>Bhindi Ki Sabzi</h1>
	<p>When I was 11 years old, we had to move to Aurangabad, which was a dusty, quiet little town, not very bad as
		far as small towns go. But for a kid who'd grown used to -- and quite liked -- that almost-colonial
		culture that one can find among devout Catholics, Aurangabad felt like a dreadful downgrade.</p>
	<p>I hated it there. The neighborhood children were wild savages compared to my catechism-attending, preppy
		friends back in Nashik; the dust was suffocating -- my allergies meant I nursed a bad cold all year
		round; and few kids read books, or even played video games.</p>
	<p>The school was murderous, literally: in my four years at my alma mater (which I will not name publicly lest I
		get hurt), one eigth-grader was shanked, a ninth-grader was pushed off the roof, and another was kicked
		off his bike into traffic. Our classrooms were in corridors that more resembled leaky dungeons than
		basements, and dozens of children crowding together didn't make for a healthy atmosphere in the least:
		At one point, I caught tuberculosis and malaria <em>at the same time</em>.
	<p>Suffice it to say I had more reason than laziness and the justified fear of bullying to avoid school, and
		avoid it I did with all the guile my 11-year-old mind could come up with. The constant sickness helped,
		too.</p>
	<p>Anyway, here's my mom's recipe for a lovely, light and spicy dry okra curry. If you've read my fenugreek
		curry recipe, you'll find this is even simpler. I have fond memories of not eating this okra curry
		during recess, mostly because I'd be dealing with some sort of bullying or ostracization at school. I
		hope you like it!

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>250gm fresh okra, diced thin</li>
		<li>2 medium-sized onions, diced</li>
		<li>A handful of curry leaves</li>
		<li>6-8 cloves of garlic, chopped thin</li>
		<li>3 green chillies, chopped thin</li>
		<li>3 teaspoons of black mustard seeds</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon of red chilly powder</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons of turmeric</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Method</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>First, heat up a skillet on medium-to-high heat, and then add 3 tablespoons of oil;</li>
		<li>Add the mustard seeds and wait for them to pop;</li>
		<li>Then pour in the chopped onions, garlic, chillies, and curry leaves;</li>
		<li>Wait till the onions turn brown, then add in the chopped okra;</li>
		<li>Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of turmeric, 3 teaspoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of red chilly powder;</li>
		<li>Mix thoroughly, and stir occassionally until the okra is soft and pliable;</li>
		<li>You can even let the okra char a little to give the dish some texture and add a lovely counterpoint
			to the soft sweetness of the onions.</li>

	</ol>
	<p>And there you have it! I love this dish. It's super simple to throw together and you just can't go wrong --
		it even tastes good if you burn it a little! Enjoy!</p>
