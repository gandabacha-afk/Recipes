	<p>There was a time when my only friends were imaginary. No, Dear Reader, I am not expecting sympathy or pity --
		this is simply a lengthy preamble to a simple recipe. But stay with me; there is a point to this
		rambling.</p>
	<p>I don't mean to paint a sorry picture of my childhood here; I did have very real, tangible companions in
		school and in the neighbourhood. But they were not my friends. My <em>real</em> friends were infinitely
		more ephemeral than the morning birdsong in the trees around our Silvasahome, but to a child starved of
		that understanding and faux-empathy that only other children can offer, they were as real as the rocks I
		skipped on the pond nearby.</p>
	<p><strong>Frank</strong> was tall and strong, the best among us at climbing trees, skipping stones, flying
		kites and also the fastest runner. I wanted to be like Frank the most. <em>Sunil</em> was flighty,
		clever, and quick to anger and fits of gigglesalike. He led us in mischief, crafted mad
		plans to steal guavas from the neighbour's tree, and was always the first to bail when
		we inevitably got caught. <u>Rahul</u> was quiet and perceptive, but he was by far the
		smartest of us all, pointing out the flaws in Sunil's harebrained schemes even before
		the boy had finished talking. He was also the one who got us out of trouble most often
		or had us in fits with puns and silly jokes, reserving his wit for when it would have
		the most impact. But kind <strong>Neha</strong> was whom I was closest to, reminding me as she did of my
		departed grandmother. She'd always wait for me to catch up to the rest, explaining what
		passed between the others through mere glances, and sharing quiet jokes about the
		stupidity of pre-teen boys.</p>
	<p>Now even at seven years old, I was well aware of the reality of my friends' inexistance, but a lonely mind
		does not care for the
		nature of the source which gives compassion so freely. And so I very quietly played, laughed, schemed,
		raced and fought with Frank, Sunil, Rahul and Neha. My parents were understandably concerned about my
		withdrawn and inwardly focused development, but I like to think of those days warmly. Real or otherwise,
		friends bring unique joys and colours to our lives, and I'm happy I understood that at some level all
		those years ago.</p>
	<p>Anyway, here's a recipe for upma, a simple South Indian breakfast made with semolina (rava), curry leaves,
		lentils and some vegetables. It's full of carbs, protein, fiber, and various lovely textures that will
		have you ready and full of energy for any kind of day.</p>


	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup unroasted fine semolina, AKA "suji", "rava"</li>
		<li>1 medium-sized onion, sliced or chopped fine</li>
		<li>2 green chillies</li>
		<li>1/2 inch of ginger, grated or minced</li>
		<li>1/2 cup green peas</li>
		<li>1/2 cup carrots, chopped finely</li>
		<li>2 tender French beans, chopped finely</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon black mustard seeds</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon split black gram (urad dal)</li>
		<li>1.5 teaspoon bengal gram (chana dal)</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons of peanuts, skinned</li>
		<li>8-10 cashews, split</li>
		<li>1 sprig of curry leaves</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Method</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Roast the semolina in a pan on low to medium heat until it turns crunchy. Keep stirring to prevent
			it from discoloring. We don't want it to turn brown. Set it aside to cool.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, in another pan, pour 2-2.5 tablespoons of oil into a hot pan, wait for it to heat up,
			then add the mustard and cumin seeds.</li>
		<li>When the seeds sputter, add in the black gram and bengal gram, and fry until they're golden-brown in
			color.</li>
		<li>Now, add the cashews and fry until they're golden brown and the lentils turn light brown.</li>
		<li>Next, throw in the curry leaves, ginger and green chillies, and fry for a minute until you smell the
			ginger and the curry leaves turn crisp.</li>
		<li>Now it's time to add the onions and vegetables; sautee until the onions turn transparent.</li>
		<li>Cover the pan and continue cooking until the vegetables become slightly tender.</li>
		<li>Pour in 2-3 cups of water (depending on how dry you want it) and add 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Mix well.
		</li>
		<li>Taste it; the water should be slightly salty -- not too much.</li>
		<li>Bring the water to boil, then turn down the stove to low heat.</li>
		<li>While the water is still boiling, slowly pour in the roasted semolina while stirrin -- you don't
			want the semolina to turn clumpy, so stir well to ensure it integrates properly with the water.
		</li>
		<li>Break up any clumps if you see them and continue stirring.</li>
		<li>The semolina will absorb all the water; at this point, cover the pan and let it cook for 2-4
			minutes.</li>
		<li>Open the lid and stir well. If it's too clumpy, you may need to add a little more water.</li>
		<li>Garnish with roasted peanuts.</li>
		<li>Serve hot with popadums, pickle, or sambar! Bone apple tea!</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I usually like to sprinkle a tiny bit of sugar on top of my serving to offset the spice and lend the flavor
		some complexity. It's totally personal preference, however, so try it out if you want to. Hope you like
		it!</p>
