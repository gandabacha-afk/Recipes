	<p>They say there's no recipe on the planet that isn't prefaced by someone's life story, so obviously I have to
		stick with tradition.</p>
	<p>When I was 6 years old, I was by all accounts an annoying little shit with no regard for others' feelings,
		time or limits of exasperation. I would, so my parents remind me to this day 30 years later, refuse to
		go to school, study, brush my teeth, take a bath, do homework, or even act like a sane human being.
		Looking back, it's no wonder my dad's play-fighting punches hit like a truck when he used to take time
		off on Sundays to "teach me karate."</p>
	<p>Now, it's not much of a defense, but I was 6 and had as much intelligence or agency as a squirrel in heat.
		The entire world was new and alluring as fuck and I had to go to <em>school</em>? The atrocity! How dare
		anyone tell me what to do!?</p>

	<p>Thirty years later, little has changed, or so it seems from my parents' opinion of how I live my life and
		choice of spewing words for a career. They aren't wrong, though: people can't really change some things
		about themselves. Six-year-old Ram Iyer didn't give a flying fuck about what his parents wanted, and I
		still don't.</p>

	<p>So, with that out of the way, here's my mom's very simple but quite delicious fenugreek sabzi, with tomatoes
		for a touch of sweetness to temper the earthy taste, and garlic to add a smidgen of flavor to the heat
		of the chillies.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 bunch of fenugreek, de-stemmed and chopped</li>
		<li>3 green chillies, diced</li>
		<li>1 large tomatoes or 2 small ones, diced</li>
		<li>Turmeric</li>
		<li>Red chilly powder</li>
		<li>5-6 cloves of garlic, diced</li>
		<li>2 medium-sized onions, chopped fine</li>
		<li>2-3 teaspoons black mustard seeds</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Method</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>First, heat up a skillet on medium-to-high heat, and pour in 2-3 tablespoons of oil</li>
		<li>Quickly add the mustard seeds, and wait for them to pop</li>
		<li>When they've calmed down, add in the green chillies and onions. Stir.</li>
		<li>Wait for the onions to release water, then add in the garlic, tomatoes and fenugreek.</li>
		<li>Season with turmeric, sprinkle 3 teaspoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of red chilly powder. Mix it
			thoroughly.</li>
		<li>Add half a small cup of water and cover the skillet to let it simmer.</li>
		<li>Check in after 8-10 minutes -- the fenugreek should cook quickly, but you don't want the sabzi to be
			watery; just a little moist.</li>
		<li>Serve hot with chapatis! Bone Apple Tea!</li>
	</ol>

	<p>And there you have it! My mom's famous methi ki sabzi. It's admittedly quite simple, and I'm sure mom makes
		it much better than I do, but hey, I do what I can. Enjoy!</p>
